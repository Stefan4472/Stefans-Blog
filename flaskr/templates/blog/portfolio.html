<hr/>

<p><em>I received my BS in Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and am currently in the final year of my Master's in Software Engineering at the Technical University of Munich. This page is all about the projects I've done for fun or for school; please see <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefan-kussmaul/">my LinkedIn profile</a> for information about my professional experience.</em></p>
<p><em>I have made almost all of my code open source. Unfortunately, some projects were closed source.</em></p>

    <h4>Stefan on Software (2017-)</h4>
    <p>I've been working on this website on and off since 2017, when I decided to try making something with <strong>Python Flask</strong>. I developed the site layout with <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, which makes it possible to adjust how the website is displayed based on the size of the screen. I'm no UX designer, but I do my best to make this site reasonably easy on the eyes.</p>
    <p>I host this website on PythonAnywhere and post articles via an API I developed. I write posts in Markdown, which then gets rendered to HTML as part of that upload process. I also wrote <a href="https://github.com/Stefan4472/simple-search-engine">a search engine</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/Stefan4472/site-analytics">web service to analyze site traffic</a> to go along with it.</p>

<div id="site-analytics" class="mb-3">
    <h4>Site Analytics (2020-2022)</h4>
    <p>Site Analytics is a <strong>Python Flask</strong> service I developed to record and analyze the web traffic I receive on this website. I use <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> for data storage and <strong>SQLAlchemy</strong> as an ORM</p>
    <p>The service uses an API to record traffic, and a separate API to query results. Using the Query API, I posted an analysis of more than 30,000 requests received by my site over the past two years. I was able to do interesting things like see the geographic distribution of "bots" viewing my site and determine the operating systems used by people viewing my site</p>

    <h4>Benchmarking Caching Technologies for Ephemeral Workloads (2022)</h4>
    <p>I did a research project at the Technical University of Munich to test the performance of various caching technologies for workloads of ephemeral data. I developed a <strong>C++</strong> benchmarking program capable of simulating various workloads, and tested four different technologies on a compute cluster using <strong>Docker</strong>. I wrote a paper about the results.</p>

<div id="bfn-marketplace" class="mb-3">
    <h4>BFN Marketplace (2020)</h4>
    <p>I led a group of students in developing a project staffing software solution for <a href="https://www.maibornwolff.de/en">MaibornWolff</a>, a Munich-based software consultancy. We developed our product using <strong>Java Spring</strong>, <strong>React</strong>, and <strong>Bootstrap</strong>. Our product was very well received and brought into internal use at MaibornWolff.</p>

<div id="bavarian-election-system" class="mb-3">
    <h4>Bavarian Election System (2020)</h4>
    <p>Working with another student, I developed an electronic voting system for the Bavarian parliamentary elections. We developed our backend with <strong>Python Flask</strong> and <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>, performed load-testing with <strong>Locust</strong>, and wrote our frontend with <strong>React</strong>. This project gave me much experience in designing and implementing a sophisticated database application.</p>

<div id="portfolio-viewer" class="mb-3">
    <h4>Portfolio Analyzer (2020)</h4>
    <p>Following the March 2020 stock market crash, I became very interested in investing. I wrote a <strong>Python</strong> program to analyze and compare an arbitrary number of user-defined stock portfolios over time. The program scrapes stock data from <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Finance</a>.</p>

<div id="duckietown-robot" class="mb-3">
    <h4>DuckieTown Robot (2019)</h4>
    <p>Working with four other students, I led the development of an autonomous-driving robot. I was responsible for writing all low-level motor control code in <strong>Arduino</strong>. I also wrote the communications bus and much of the driving logic in <strong>Python</strong>. Our project won the competition for being best in the class, and completed the "driving course" with only a single point deduction!</p>

<div id="spaceships-online" class="mb-3">
    <h4>Spaceships Online (2018)</h4>
    <p>Curious about online games, I learned <strong>Javascript</strong> and used <strong>NodeJS</strong> to write an online multiplayer shooting game. I read articles about game networking and learned enough to implement an authoritative game backend from scratch. Unfortunately, I didn't finish the project, but I plan to come back to it!</p>
