<h1>Portfolio</h1>
<p>Over the course of my "career" I've worked on a lot of different projects! I've given short summaries of my two biggest projects below, with links to full, in-depth articles! I'm also working on covering some of the smaller projects I've worked on and will be updating this page as I do so.</p>

<img alt="Short gameplay gif from my C++ adventure game" src="/static/portfolio/cpp_adventure_gameplay_1.gif" />

<p>My current big project is writing a game in C++ from scratch. It's a top-down, two-dimensional adventure game in pixel-art style (kind of similar to Pokemon). Read more here.</p>

<p>I'm also currently writing an online multiplayer game in Javascript (also from scratch). It's in early stages, but you can check it out online here!</p>

<img alt="Short gameplay gif from my Spaceships android game" src="/static/portfolio/spaceships_gameplay_1.gif" />

<p>I worked on writing an Android space arcade game for a while--I called it Spaceships (not super creative, I know. I'm still thinking about a better name). The game is fairly close to completion, but I'm taking a break to work on other things. Read more here.</p>
