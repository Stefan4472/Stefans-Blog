    This API is used to manage [the StefanOnSoftware blog](https://www.stefanonsoftware.com). Code for the StefanOnSoftware website is open-source and can be found [on Github](https://github.com/Stefan4472/Stefans-Blog).

    ## Blog Posts
    The main use of this API is to create, manage, and publish blog posts.

    Posts begin in a private draft stage and only become visible on the public website once they have been published. Once published, the post is available at a URL that uses its slug (e.g., 'www.stefanonsoftware.com/posts/\<slug>'). A published post can be "featured", which will lead to it being displayed on the landing page of the blog.

    Posts are written and stored in Markdown documents, which are rendered to HTML on request.

    Each post must specify three required images. The _featured_ image is displayed on the website landing page if the post is featured, and is also used as a page banner on narrow screens. The _banner_ image is used as a page banner on large screens. The _thumbnail_ image is a used when displaying the post in a listing, e.g. a search result. These images must comply with specific dimensions.

    ## Tags
    Posts can be categorized according to Tags, which serve to thematically group similar posts together and to pique readers' interest. The _tags_ API is used to create and manage tags.

    ## Files
    Posts almost always include multimedia such as images and videos. This media must be stored somewhere. The _files_ API is used by the author to upload files to the website, where they can then be used in posts.
