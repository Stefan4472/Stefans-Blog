        <h3>You are using StefanSearch</h3>
        <p>These search results were generated using a search engine I wrote in Python. It uses an index to find all
            posts that have at least one of the search queries' terms, then calculates their relevance using the QL
            language model. Queries are case-sensitive. You can check out the project on <a
                    href="https://github.com/Stefan4472/simple-search-engine">Github</a>.</p>
